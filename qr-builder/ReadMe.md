# QR Builder

Building a QR code, from purely local assets.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser, it should work fine with the `file://` protocol. Alternatively, you could use a development server such as [`serve`](http://npm.im/serve) to serve the files. It is also available in this repository's GitHub Pages instance, link below.
